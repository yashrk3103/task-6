# Task 6: Password Strength Evaluation 🚨🔒

## 📌 Objective
Understand what makes a password strong by creating multiple passwords, testing them with a password strength tool, and analyzing the results.

## 🛠 Passwords Tested & Results

| Password         | Length | Crack Time  | Strength   | Feedback                                                      |
|------------------|--------|-------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| password420      | 11     | 0.05 secs   | Very Weak  | Common word + numbers; easily guessable; lacks complexity.    |
| Pssword0         | 8      | 22 hours    | Medium     | Includes uppercase + digit but still predictable.             |
| GameOFGOAT@2026  | 15     | 13 years    | Very Strong| Long, mixes upper/lower case, numbers, symbols; good entropy. |

## ✅ Best Practices for Strong Passwords

- Make passwords **12–16+ characters** long.
- Combine **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**.
- Avoid **common words** or patterns (e.g., "password123").
- Use **passphrases** (e.g., `MyDogEats$7Apples!`) for memorability + strength.
- Never **reuse passwords** across different sites.
- Enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** whenever possible.

## 🔎 Summary: Password Complexity & Security

The tests clearly show that complexity and length drastically increase the time required to crack a password. A strong password (long + random + diverse characters) can resist brute force or dictionary attacks for years, while short/common passwords can be cracked in seconds.

## 📚 Common Password Attacks

- **Brute Force Attack:** Trying every possible combination until the correct password is found.
- **Dictionary Attack:** Using lists of common passwords and words.
- **Credential Stuffing:** Using leaked credentials from other breaches.
- **Phishing:** Tricking users into revealing their passwords.

## 🎤 Interview Questions & Answers

1️⃣ **What makes a password strong?**
- Long, random, uses different character types, and not based on personal info.

2️⃣ **What are common password attacks?**
- Brute force, dictionary attacks, credential stuffing, phishing.

3️⃣ **Why is password length important?**
- Longer passwords exponentially increase the combinations attackers must try.

4️⃣ **What is a dictionary attack?**
- Attackers use lists of common passwords or words to guess a password quickly.

5️⃣ **What is multi-factor authentication?**
- Security mechanism requiring two or more verification methods (e.g., OTP + password).

6️⃣ **How do password managers help?**
- Generate, store, and autofill complex unique passwords securely.

7️⃣ **What are passphrases?**
- Long passwords made of multiple words; easier to remember but very secure.

8️⃣ **What are common mistakes in password creation?**
- Short passwords, common patterns, personal info, reusing passwords across sites.
